# Will pulling a wish at specific time in Genshin Impact generate better result?

Genshin Impact is a gacha game in which players spend their primogems (acquired in game and using real money) to pull wishes. 
The wishes are accumulated and after players make a certain number of wishes, they have better chance to obtain a rare (4 or 5 star) item/character, hence the gacha system.
The game specifically states that: As a pity system, every 10 wishes results in a 4-star, and every 90 wishes results in a 5-star! However it is quite common for players to get a rare item/character even before they hit the pity (i.e. a 4-star when players only wish 8 times, or a 5-star when only 50 wishes have been made).
As of now, there has been no way for ones to get better result on their wishes, everything is total random and really based on chances. 
There is nothing you can do to get better results.

## Or is there?

This is a personal project that aims to find out whether there is a causation relationship between the time I pull the author's wishes and their drop rate. 
The data is generated from the author's own wish history, which will be updated in the future when they have more means (i.e. primogems) to do so.

## !! Disclaimer
This is a personal machine learning project that serves the purpose of improving the author's own knowledge of machine learning and skills in using different libraries to solve the problem.
The author actually did apply the result from here to pull wishes and did not get a better overall result!
